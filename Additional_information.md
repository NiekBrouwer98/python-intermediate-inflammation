# Software Development as a Process

## Business requirements
* BR1: improving the statistical quality of clinical trial reporting to meet the needs of external audits
* BR2: increasing the throughput of trial analyses to meet higher demand during peak periods

One hypothetical new business requirement (BR3) could be extending our clinical trial system to keep track of doctors who are being involved in the project.

Another hypothetical new business requirement (BR4) may be adding a new parameter to the treatment and checking if it improves the effect of the drug being tested - e.g. taking it in conjunction with omega-3 fatty acids and/or increasing physical activity while taking the drug therapy.

## User (or stakeholder) Requirements

* UR1.1 (from BR1): add support for statistical measures in generated trial reports as required by revised auditing standards (standard deviation, â€¦)
* UR1.2 (from BR1): add support for producing textual representations of statistics in trial reports as required by revised auditing standards
* UR2.1 (from BR2): ability to have an individual trial report processed and generated in under 30 seconds (if we assume it usually takes longer than that)

## Solition Requirements

*Functional requirements* focus on functions and features of a solution. For our software, building on our user requirements, e.g.:
* SR1.1.1 (from UR1.1): add standard deviation to data model and include a graph visualisation view
* SR1.2.1 (from UR1.2): add a new view to generate a textual representation of statistics, which is invoked by an optional command line argument

*Non-functional requirements* focus on how the behaviour of a solution is expressed or constrained, e.g. performance, security, usability, or portability. These are also known as quality of service requirements. For our project, e.g.:
* SR2.1.1 (from UR2.1): generate graphical statistics report on clinical workstation configuration in under 30 seconds
